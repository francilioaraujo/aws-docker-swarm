# AWS Docker Swarm

This repository shows a very basic code to spin up a docker swarm cluster
in AWS. This code is purposely basic and shouldn't be used in production
unmodified.

The infrastructure provisioning code is inside the `terraform`
directory. You must have a pair of authentication keys in your computer
to access the instances. The code creates two groups of instances,
managers and workers.

the infrastructure configuration code is inside the `ansible`
directory. It installs docker, its dependencies and set up a swarm
cluster. You can access the docker engine inside the manager nodes using
ssh by setting the `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://ubuntu@<a master ip>` environment
variable or adding `-H ssh://ubuntu@<a master ip>` to your docker client.
